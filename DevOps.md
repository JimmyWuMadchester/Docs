# Tests

The difference from UAT tests and Integration test, in my personal terminology, is that the UAT uses direct automation of User Interface, while integration tests can skip the UI and exercise the system directly from public API (REST, MSMQ Commands, etc).

Running integration and UAT tests is a task that is usually done in a different machine from that one running the build. This happens because that machine should be carefully prepared to run the tests and simplify deployment of the new version.
