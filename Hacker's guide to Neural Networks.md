# Hacker's guide to Neural Networks

Another study note from reading [Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) about Neural Networks.

## Notes

> The majority of cost functions in Machine Learning consist of two parts: 1. A part that measures how well a model fits the data, and 2: Regularization, which measures some notion of how complex or likely a model is.
