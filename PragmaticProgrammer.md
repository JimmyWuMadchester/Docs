## When should You Refactor?

Any number of things you may cause code to qualify for refactoring:

* **Duplication**. You've discovered a violation of the DRY principle
* **Nonorthogonal** design. You've discovered some code or design that could be made more orthogonal.
* **Outdated knowledge**. Things change, requirements drift, and your knowledge of the problem increases. Code needs to keep up.
* **Performance**. You need to move functionality from one area of the system to another to improve performance.
