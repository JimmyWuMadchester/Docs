# The Design of Everyday Things *Author: Don Norman*

I think it's key to understand the design principles while doing any systems or UX designs. This very old book revised fairly recently is a good starting point for non-designers. As a software developer working on Web technology stacks most of my time, I found this book very intriguing. I am more aware of good and bad designs in daily life as well as working on software products. I believe in better design that reduces our stress level while using systems and products in life and work.

## Glossary

**Affordances**:

The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single person (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not afford lifting.

**Signifiers**:

The term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person.

Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both.

## Seven fundamental principles of design
* **Discoverability.** It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device.
* **Feedback.** There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
* **Conceptual model.** The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results.
* **Affordances.** The proper affordances exist to make the desired actions possible.
* **Signifiers.** Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.
* **Mappings.** The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.
* **Constraints.** Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.

## Other notes I have so far while reading this book.

>The same technology that simplifies life by providing more
functions in each device also complicates life by making the device
harder to learn, harder to use. This is the paradox of technology
and the challenge for the designer.

>What about radical ideas, ones that introduce
new product categories to the marketplace? These come about by
reconsidering the goals, and always asking what the real goal is:
what is called the root cause analysis.

>What about Beethoven’s phone number? If I asked my computer, it would take a long time, because it would have to search all the people I know to see whether any one of them was Beethoven. But you immediately discarded the question as nonsensical. You don’t personally know Beethoven. And anyway, he is dead. Besides,
he died in the early 1800s and the phone wasn’t invented
until the late 1800s. How do we know what we do not know so
rapidly? Yet some things that we do know can take a long time to
retrieve.

>Emotion is highly underrated. In fact, the emotional system is
a powerful information processing system that works in tandem
with cognition. Cognition attempts to make sense of the world:
emotion assigns value. It is the emotional system that determines
whether a situation is safe or threatening, whether something that
is happening is good or bad, desirable or not. Cognition provides
understanding: emotion provides value judgments. A human without
a working emotional system has difficulty making choices. A
human without a cognitive system is dysfunctional.

>Because much human behavior is subconscious—that is, it occurs
without conscious awareness—we often don’t know what we
are about to do, say, or think until after we have done it. It’s as
if we had two minds: the subconscious and the conscious, which
don’t always talk to each other. Not what you have been taught?
True, nonetheless. More and more evidence is accumulating that
we use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to
ourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others. Bizarre? Yes, but
don’t protest: enjoy it.

> a useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion
is to consider three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and
reflective.
