# Machine Learning Yearning

Supervised learning: Learning a function that maps from x
to y, using labeled training examples (x,y). Supervised learning algorithms include **linear
regression, logistic regression, and neural networks**. There are many forms of machine
learning, but the majority of machine learning’s practical value today is from supervised
learning.

We usually define:

* Training set — Which you run your learning algorithm on.
* Dev (development) set — Which you use to tune parameters, select features, and
make other decisions regarding the learning algorithm. Sometimes also called the holdout
cross validation set.
* Test set — which you use to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, but not to make
any decisions about regarding what learning algorithm or parameters to use.
