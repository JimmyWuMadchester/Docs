# Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

## Ch.4 Function invovation

When invoked with the keyword ```new```, an empty object instance is created and passed to the function as its function context, the ```this``` parameter.

## Ch.7 Object orientation with prototypes

```instanceof``` checks whether the prototype of the right-side function is in the prototype chain of the object on the left.

## Ch.8 Controlling access to objects

Getters and setters allow us to define object
properties that are used like standard object properties, but are methods that can execute
additional code whenever we read or write to a particular property. This is an
incredibly useful feature that enables us to perform logging, validate assignment values,
and even notify other parts of the code when certain changes occur.
